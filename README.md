# quiz2
Repo for the second quiz, debugging and writing code

# Instructions

Go through the code as it is presented

CSS and JS files must be properly imported into the `quiz2.html` file

Fix any errors you find. These could be one or more of the following:
 - broken html (tags, spelling, etc)
 - bad javascript
 - poorly written CSS
 - file tree organization

There should be no console errors when the code is executed, and while some browsers may fix bad code for you, the code must be fixed as we can't always rely on browsers picking up the slack

Pay attention to the comments in the files as well, you will find extra instructions to fulfill all the requirements.

You don't have to make any new or more styles....but it certainly wouldn't hurt to do so.

Come to me with any quesitons you may have
