// write jQuery or vanilla javascript to do the following:
//  - loop through the list itmes in the <ol> and change their text and color to be different from what it is now
//  - use js and html to create at least one custom accordion (by yourself, no copy paste)
//  - create a button in the html that, once clicked, will fire off the function described in the next buller point
//  - write a function that will fade out all of the html inside the body tag and replace it with a custom goodbye message when you click the button
//  - finally, write a function that makes you happy :D (as in, have some fun a write something cool, it's up to you!)
